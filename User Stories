A Domain Model is : "an abstract representation of the objects within a system,
                    and the messages they use to communicate with one another."

                    They consist of entities (as rectangles) with their relationships
                    delineated with lines and arrows.

                    "A way to get a broad-brush overview of an area of interest"

                    One of the first steps in translating user stories into class
                    structures, as well as in the software design process generally.

A Feature Test is : "is a test of how those objects and messages work together
                     in code."

A Stack Trace is  : will give you an example of what caused the error, the path
                    in which the error happened, and the line number.

                    "LoadError: cannot load such file -- ./docking_station.rb

How to use one    : (After picking error apart with pair) take the name
                    (e.g.LoadError) to Rubydocs and search for it under exceptions.

                    If the error is one that we wanted to return, we can use it
                    guide our Unit Tests (RSpec) to hopefully fail with something
                    like the same error messages.
